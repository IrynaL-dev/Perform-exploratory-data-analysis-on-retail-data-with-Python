# Perform exploratory data analysis on retail data with Python
In this project, I will step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at an online retail company, helping interpret real-world data to help make key business decisions.
My challenge is to conduct an exploratory data analysis to help make key business decisions. To do this, I will load, clean, process, analyze, and visualize data. I will also pose questions, and seek to answer them meaningfully using the dataset provided.

In this project, I'll use a data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.
